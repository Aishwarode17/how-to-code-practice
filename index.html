<!--here everything is done by using bootstrap and some custom classes col-12 is used because bootstrap grid have 12 width and col-12 is given so that it use the maximum of 12 width .also h-100 class is given to make the height of the container and body same which is 100% . and by doing  this the everything inside container which is already in the center by align-items center . so if the items are in center of container and the height of the container and the body are same than it appears that the items are in the center of the body which covers the 100% of the webpage.-->
